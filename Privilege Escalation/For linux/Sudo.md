The sudo command allows users to run programs with elevated (root) privileges. In cases where full root access isn't necessary or allowed, system administrators can configure granular sudo privileges for users, allowing them to run specific commands with root privileges while maintaining their regular permission level for the rest of the system.

Any user can check its current situation related to root privileges using the sudo -l command.
