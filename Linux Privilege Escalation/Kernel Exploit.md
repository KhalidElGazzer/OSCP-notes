The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computerâ€™s operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system. It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components. 

This critical function requires the kernel to have specific privileges; thus, a successful exploit will potentially lead to root privileges.
