Basic Information
------------------
NFS is a system designed for client/server that enables users to seamlessly access files over a network as though these files were located within a local directory.

A notable aspect of this protocol is its lack of built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms. Instead, authorization relies on file system information, with the server tasked with accurately translating client-provided user information into the file system's required authorization format, primarily following UNIX syntax.

Authentication commonly relies on UNIX 
UID
/
GID
 identifiers and group memberships. However, a challenge arises due to the potential mismatch in 
UID
/
GID
 mappings between clients and servers, leaving no room for additional verification by the server. Consequently, the protocol is best suited for use within trusted networks, given its reliance on this method of authentication.

Default port: 2049/TCP/UDP (except version 4, it just needs TCP or UDP).
```
2049/tcp open  nfs     2-3 (RPC #100003
```







Enumeration
------------
Useful nmap scripts
```
nfs-ls #List NFS exports and check permissions
nfs-showmount #Like showmount -e
nfs-statfs #Disk statistics and info from NFS share
```
Useful metasploit modules
```
scanner/nfs/nfsmount #Scan NFS mounts and list permissions
```
Mounting
---------

To know which folder has the server available to mount you an ask it using:
```
showmount -e <IP>
```
Then mount it using:
```
sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=4,nolock <target ip>:<NFSshare> ~/path/to/your/local/directory/
cd ~/path/to/your/local/directory/
```
